# kitty-construction
Permafrost portfolio website was made mainly with the goal of using it for securing a job in web design and development. It might be helpful to other students 
learning code to study the structure of HTML and CSS, and JavaScript; also helpful to potential employers to display my skill level.

Kitty Construction website/game page was created with the intent of making a graphic design and web design/development course that plays as a game, making it more engaging for those wanting to learn. 

Features:
This website includes:
* Game page with course sections for Design, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* CSS cat (more to come) that will demonstrate examples for exercises
* Stoplight system for uploading exercises for progress: glowing red means not started or just started, yellow means in progress, green means completed

How to run Kitty Construction website locally:
Clone from Github into a local folder
https://github.com/frosty8104/kitty-construction

ToDo list:
* Get JavaScript connected so buttons, sections, lights, theme changing, etc. work
* Add divs I missed when developing the initial webpage
* Test out game to make sure there are no bugs
